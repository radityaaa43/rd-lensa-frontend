# BI rules for the Iroha 3 gateways (target "iroha3"), one gateway per party. Envoy tags the door {target: "iroha3", node: "bi"|"bank-a"|
# "bank-b"|"bank-c"}, forwards the verified client leaf in x-forwarded-client-cert (SANITIZE_SET) and sends method and path (the path
# carries the query string); there is no body. `allow` = a role from the verified leaf AND a route row that allows that role at this node.
# Roles by certificate CN, exactly: lensa, bank-a, bank-b, bank-c, bi. The leaf is verified for ClientAuth against a public CA from
# data.bi.config.iroha3_ca (no CA data: nothing passes):
#   lensa              CN `lensa`, signed directly by iroha3_ca.lensa[<node>], the Lensa client CA of THIS gateway's party
#   bank-a/b/c, bi     CN = the role, signed directly by iroha3_ca.role[<that role>], the role's own CA
# No certificate, a second Cert element, a leaf of another CA, another CN or server-only key usage: denied.
# Routes (iroha3-opa-ops rows 1-12; method and path match exactly, anchored, nothing else passes; row 13, the auditor, is below the rows):
#   1-4   GET   health, public reads, tx status (hash=<64 hex>[&scope=]), balance reads (owned_by=<I105>)   lensa, bank-*, bi
#   5-7   POST/GET  signed tx submit, APS client calls and reads                                            bank-*, bi (not lensa)
#   8     POST  audit capsule/approvals                                                                     bi

#   11    POST /mint                                                                                        lensa, node bi only
#   12    GET /tx/<64 hex>                                                                                  lensa; bi role at node bi only
